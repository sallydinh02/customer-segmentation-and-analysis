### Recommendations:

Products that need more marketing:
* Sweet and Fruit products need effective marketing stratergies since these are the two least purchased types of products. The store needs to promote these products to increase the revenue from these products. For example, the store can combine the least selling products with best-selling products as a promotion.

Marketing recommendation:
* Provide coupons to customer groups with high spendings to encourage customers to purchase.
* Market low-priced products to customers group with lower income and spendings
* Online shopping has potential, so the store can offer special discounts for online shopping or customers who have accounts
